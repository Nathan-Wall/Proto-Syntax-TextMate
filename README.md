### Proto Syntax Highlighting for TextMate and Sublime Text

This has been tested in Sublime Text 2.  It should theoretically work in TextMate as well, since Sublime Text uses the same kind of file for setting up syntax highlighting.

#### Use

##### Sublime Text

Copy the `Proto.tmLanguage` file into your `Packages` folder for Sublime Text.

Then in Sublime Text click **View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as... -> Proto**.
